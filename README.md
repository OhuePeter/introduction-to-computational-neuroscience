This file is designed to be used alongside the textbook, "Introduction to Computational Neuroscience". It provides practical Python implementations that complement the concepts discussed in the text.

For the best experience and efficient execution of the code, we recommend running the notebooks on Google Colab. This ensures compatibility and removes the need for local installations.

If you encounter any issues, errors, or unexpected behaviour while using the code, please report them to the authors. Your feedback is highly valued and will help us improve and maintain these resources.
